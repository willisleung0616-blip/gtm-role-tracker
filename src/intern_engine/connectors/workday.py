"""Workday (enterprise tier) — the biggest ATS in intern hiring.

Per-tenant POST API behind bot management. Two public URL shapes exist and we
support both:
  subdomain:  https://{tenant}.{wd}.myworkdayjobs.com/{site}
  path-style: https://{wd}.myworkdaysite.com/recruiting/{tenant}/{site}
The CXS JSON API lives under /wday/cxs/{tenant}/{site} on either host.

The API caps each page at 20 postings, so we paginate — big tech tenants list
far more than 20 intern roles at peak season. Dates are relative text
("Posted 6 Days Ago"); we resolve precise ones here and the enrichment stage
backfills exact dates from the job detail endpoint.

Cloud IPs are blocked more than home IPs, so the pipeline routes this connector
through an optional proxy (WORKDAY_PROXY) when one is configured.
