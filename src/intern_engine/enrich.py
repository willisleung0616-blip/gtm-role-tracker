"""Enrichment: attach posting text to matched roles and classify sponsorship.

Cost model: this runs ONLY on roles that already passed every filter (a handful
per run, not thousands). Lever/Ashby/Amazon/Recruitee ship descriptions in their
list payloads, so those classify for free; Greenhouse/SmartRecruiters/Workday/
Oracle need one detail request per NEW role, after which the verdict is stored
and never re-fetched. Workday details also carry the exact posting date, which
backfills rows the list API only described as "N days ago".
