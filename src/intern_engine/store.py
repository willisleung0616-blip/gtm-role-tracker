"""Persistent job state, stored as a single human-diffable JSON file.

Why JSON and not SQLite for this repo: the file is committed back to the repo by
GitHub Actions each run, so a text file gives clean diffs ("3 jobs added") and
zero binary/database-persistence headaches. The store is a dict keyed by job id.

Lifecycle work that happens here:
  - first-seen tracking: the moment WE first saw a job (powers "🆕" + sorting)
  - open/closed tracking: a job not seen in a successful fetch is marked closed,
    with a closed_at timestamp (powers the "recently closed" section)
  - retention: long-closed records are purged so the file never grows unbounded

    off-cycle, not a tech internship) is closed as out-of-scope no matter how
    complete the snapshot was: that verdict is ours to make, and it needs no
